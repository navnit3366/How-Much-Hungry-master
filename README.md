<h1> How Much Hungry? </h1>
This is the mini project for the MU Computer (sem4) for subject OSTL.

<h3>Idea</h3>
 <p>I live in a hostel. Most of the time we order food from online sites like Zomato/Swiggy. But since there are lot of options available, we end up wasting hours deciding what to order. To resolve this issue, I've created this simple project which let's user decide food intuitively.</p>

<p>As we can see, user has to answer just 4 questions to get the food list. There are very few options compared to the entire zomato site. Hence it is very easy for user to decide the food.</p>

<h3>Implementation:</h3>
<p>1. Database:</p>
<p>SQLite3 database is used for this project. SELECT commands are used to get the data from dataset.</p>
<p>2. GUI:</p>
<p>Tkinter is used to make the GUI. It is the basic level GUI which is very easy to understand for a beginner.</p>
